TO RUN LOCALLY FOR FIRST TIME:
1. cd into ```watersharing-py/watersharing/code```

2. In terminal enter: ```conda create -n gwpc-env python=3.8 pip --yes``` 
    followed by ```conda activate gwpc-env```

3. Next install the requirements by entering ```pip install -r requirements-dev.txt```

4. Then enter this into the terminal as well ```idaes get-extensions --verbose```

5. Next, ```conda install --channel conda-forge pyscipopt```

6. Make sure you have numpy installed: ```conda install numpy```

7. In terminal, to run the matching scripts locally, type ```python codeTrigger.py --mode local``` and then move a correctly formatted json file into ./export_local

8. After running, a few files should be created with matches and distances in JSON format within the import_local folder 

**If you run into errors regarding SCIP on MacOS, try using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to [install scip](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/scip)**

**If you would like to keep the trigger actively searching for new matches(similar to the intended use), run it via ```python codeTrigger.py &``` to run the script in the background. You may kill this process by typing ```jobs -l``` finding the identifying number for the process and then typing ```kill <id>``` You can test the json file generation by either copying a json file into the ./export_local folder or setting up a local MAMP environment using the watersharing wordpress repo and redirecting the local path(config.yaml) to the export folder in /io/export. Upon filling out one of the forms a json file will be sent to the export folder and matches should be created as intended**

ON THE SERVER:

1. Run the trigger script using the command ```nohup python codeTrigger.py &  --mode production```. All the 'nohup' prefix is doing is keeping the script running after you close the ssh window

2. Check the trigger is running by typing ```ps -ef | grep â€œpython codeTrigger.py"``` instead of what is mentioned above. Killing the trigger process can be done similarly using the kill command and the id you find using the aforementioned command

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
**You may change the path which the code is using to search for new json files by modifying the entries within config.yaml. The local_vars are meant to test with files in the local directory and the production_vars are meant to point at a wordpress directory**
